[EXAMPLE PAGE](./Example Page.jpeg)

- Use CSS to make your page look as close to the example as you can.<br>
<br>
- The font is ```sans-serif```, the colors are ```darkred``` and ```##ffde05```
  
- Change the **size** and/or **font-style** of the ```<h1>```,```<h2>```,```<h3>``` elements so that they match the example as close as you can.<br>
<br>
- All of the images are in your file tree.  They should be ```300px```. Add the borders and try to replicate the width, border color and radius as close as you can.<br>
<br>
- Make the YouTube video viewable on the page.<br>
<br>
- Turn the links into clickable hyperlinks. Make sure the link color of the hyperlinks are white and the font is ```sans-serif```.<br>
